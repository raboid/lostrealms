- He originally fought back the shadow in the land of molten magma. But he was defeated and took his people back to the roots.
- After hearing that frost dragon was staying to die fighting. He decided he must do something to make his death not in vain. They
learned from watching the shadow hit the frost that it grows from consuming life, so it slowed since the frost had little life. Then

he left that alone

Hearts are only lost temporary by damage

They are lost forever from vampires, corrupt hearts

players spawn in the KINGDOM REALM

players can push back the corruption by planting seeds in the corruption and if they survive to adult hood it pushes back the corruption perm in an area

eventually if players take back too much a powerful corrupt boss will be able to enter the uncorrupted area and plant corruption

your experience level with certain spells is essentially your chance of casting it correctly
spells can be cast at varying levels of badness, resulting in negative effects on the caster
In better cases it might effect the target and caster, just not do anything, or work correctly and just hit the target correctly

you can get drunk/high in the game which also makes your spells be shit and weird

The more you successfully cast the spell the more your expertise with it goes up

------
- Sometimes rocks flash after you strike them
- The more times you consecutively hit the same color the higher the chance you get that gem
- If you don't strike anything consecutively you dont get a gem

- Otherwise you either get dirt, stone, or ore that can make things
